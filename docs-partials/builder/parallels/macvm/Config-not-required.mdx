- `screen_configs` ([]parallelscommon.SingleScreenBootConfig) - Screens and it's boot configs
  A screen is considered matched if all the matching strings are present in the screen.
  The first matching screen will be considered & boot config of that screen will be used.
  If matching strings are empty, then it is considered as empty screen,
  which will be considered when none of the other screens are matched (You can use this screen to -
  make system wait for some time / execute a common boot command etc.).
  If more than one empty screen is found, then it is considered as an error.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the MACVM directory for the new
  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is
  "packer-BUILDNAME", where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `reassign_mac` (bool) - If this is "false" the MAC address of the first
  NIC will reused when imported else a new MAC address will be generated
  by Parallels. Defaults to "false".
