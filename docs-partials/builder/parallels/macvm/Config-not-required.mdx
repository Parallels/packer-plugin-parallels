- `boot_screen_config` (parallelscommon.BootScreensConfig) - Screens and it's boot configs
  A screen is considered matched if all the matching strings are present in the screen.
  The first matching screen will be considered & boot config of that screen will be used.
  If matching strings are empty, then it is considered as empty screen,
  empty screen has some special meaning, which will be considered when none of the other screens are matched.
  You can use this screen to make system wait for some time / execute a common boot command etc.
  The empty screen boot command will be executed repeatedly until a non-empty screen is found.
  If more than one empty screen is found, then it is considered as an error.
