- `boot_screen_config` (parallelscommon.BootScreensConfig) - Screens and it's boot configs
  A screen is considered matched if all the matching strings are present in the screen.
  The first matching screen will be considered & boot config of that screen will be used.
  If matching strings are empty, then it is considered as empty screen,
  which will be considered when none of the other screens are matched (You can use this screen to -
  make system wait for some time / execute a common boot command etc.).
  If more than one empty screen is found, then it is considered as an error.

- `ocr_library` (string) - OCR library to use. Two options are currently supported: "tesseract" and "vision".
  "tesseract" uses the Tesseract OCR library to recognize text. A manual installation of -
  Tesseract is required for this to work.
  "vision" uses the Apple Vision library to recognize text, which is included in macOS. It might -
  cause problems in macOS 13 or older VMs.
  Defaults to "vision".
