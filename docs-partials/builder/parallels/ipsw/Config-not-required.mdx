- `boot_screen_config` (parallelscommon.BootScreensConfig) - Screens and it's boot configs
  A screen is considered matched if all the matching strings are present in the screen.
  The first matching screen will be considered & boot config of that screen will be used.
  If matching strings are empty, then it is considered as empty screen,
  which will be considered when none of the other screens are matched (You can use this screen to -
  make system wait for some time / execute a common boot command etc.).
  If more than one empty screen is found, then it is considered as an error.

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
  for the VM. By default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `host_interfaces` ([]string) - A list of which interfaces on the
  host should be searched for a IP address. The first IP address found on one
  of these will be used as `{{ .HTTPIP }}` in the boot_command. Defaults to
  ["en0", "en1", "en2", "en3", "en4", "en5", "en6", "en7", "en8", "en9",
  "en10", "en11", "en12", "en13", "en14", "en15", "en16", "en17", "en18", "en19", "en20",
  "ppp0", "ppp1", "ppp2"].

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the PVM directory for the new
  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is
  "packer-BUILDNAME", where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
